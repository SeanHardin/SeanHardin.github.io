				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>
					In this game you play as Viola, a girl who wakes up finding herself in
					front of a large mansion. A quick walk around shows that she is trapped
					inside the area so she must explore the mansion to find another way out.
					The only problem being that the mansion is full of deadly traps that will
					instantly kill her at a moment's notice.

					This was the first RPG Maker horror game i had ever played and is also my
					favorite. There are plenty of save points around the mansion, so even when
					you do die to the traps, it is never too big of a setback as long as you 
					are saving. The sound effects of the game are pleasant to listen to, and 
					the puzzle design is good as well.

					her school building alongside a number of her classmates. A student who had
					disappeared 3 months ago has turned into a vengeful spirit and dragged them
					all there to get revenge. It is Aki's task to explore the school and calm the

					In my opinion this was just an average puzzle game. A lot of the deaths
					in the game are sudden and unavoidable (and frankly, uninteresting), but
					this isn't so bad because the game includes a hotkey to quicksave at a
					moment's notice (while disallowing it where it could screw you over). I 
					hate that telephone. Just walking past it kills you, in a 2 space wide
					passage, so if you aren't thinking about it, there's a 50% chance of
					sudden death without being prepared....

				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>
					In this game you play as Yonaka, a high school student who was on her
					way home to see her brother, but ends up getting spirited away to a 
					kingdom of strange cat-shaped creatures called mogeko. She Hears that
					she will be able to return home if she reaches a magical door at the
					top of the castle, so she must climb to the top all the while avoiding
					mogeko that are hunting her down.

					This one felt more like the creator was just making something stupid
					for fun, and turned it into a mess of horror and adventure. Also, I
					should warn that this game depicts scenes that many people would
					find uncomfortable, so look into it at your own discretion. For the
					rest of us who can look past that, the adventure of Yonaka to the top
					is a quirky and enjoyable story to play through. Though the best ending
					out of all possibilities is not the normal or true end, but actually one
					of the bad ends, which is just another amusing aspect of this game.
