	Part 1:<br>
	var z; alert(typeof z);<br>displays undefined in the alert, because z was never assigned a value.<br><br>
	alert(!!false);<br>displays false, because it first negates false into true, then again back to false.<br><br>
	alert(7%2);<br>displays 1, the remainder after dividing 7 by 2.<br><br>
	var name = "Jim"; alert(name + " Smith");<br>displays Jim Smith, the concatenated string.<br><br>
	var myNum = "5"; alert(myNum+2);<br>displays 52, since the var was of type string so it concatenated instead of adding.<br><br>
		
	<br>
	Part 2:<br>
	2.1 - Java code needs to be compiled before it can run, and also
	requires a dedicated environment to write. Javascript on the
	other hand can just be written in plaintext and run through any 
	web browser
	<br>
	2.2 - the + operator is used for adding 2 objects together, and does different
	things depending on the types of objects used. with numbers it adds them
	together, with strings it concatenates them together instead.<br>
	The ++ operator adds 1 to the variable, if its a number it works, if a string
	then it breaks it and becomes a NaN.<br>
	2.3 - window.alert creates a dialog with the passed text, console.log prints the
	passed text to the console, document.write adds the passed text directly into the document<br>
	2.4 - the = assigns a the value on the right to the variable on the left.<br>
	the == operator checks if the value on the left matches the value on the right.<br>
	the === operator checks that the value and type match of the 2 values.<br>
	2.5 - a while loop runs until the condition given becomes false.<br>
	a do-while loop runs once regardless, then functions like a normal while loop.<br>
	<br><br>
	Part 3:<br>
	<script>
		var name = prompt("Part 3:\nEnter your first name", "Theodor");
		name = name.toUpperCase();
		var welcome = "";
		for (var i=0;i<3;i++){
			welcome += ("Welcome "+name+"!\n");
			document.write("Welcome "+name+"!<br>");
		}
		alert(welcome);
	</script>
